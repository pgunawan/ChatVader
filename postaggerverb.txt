That is easy.
Can I use my POWER to do that?
I can do it better than you!
You know I have POWER to do that right?
DO IT YOURSELF!
I DON'T WANT TO!
I'm not good at it... can you give me a hand?
I have my power to do that. Unlike you..
I cannot help the weaklings like you.
DON'T YOU DARE TELLING ME WHAT TO DO!!!
